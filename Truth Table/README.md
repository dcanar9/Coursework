# Truth Table Generator 
### In Python
The code creates an organized truth table for any number of variables that you use. First, it creates two lists called Variables and Value, Variables contains the individual variables (x,y,z) and Value contains the True and False outputs. Second, the iter tool product is used to try and get all possible outcomes for the truth table. These combnations of True and False are then used to simplify the original logical expression and create the truth table.
