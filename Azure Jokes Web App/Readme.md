# Azure Web Application
### HTML, CSS, & PHP

This was an ongoing project for a class in 2020. The jokes application is a aset of pages that can be used to searrch jokes, login to the system, add jokes, and view results. The last modification to this project was to host it to a cloud service. I wish I could've provided a link but the time for the Azure trial expired. The files are in the jokes app folder, but I removed the sql file with the db I used so you could make one that mathces the php.
