# Hello Welcome! 
Below is a quick view of some of the work I have done over the years while attending GCU. Each project will have a title,
description, and some sample of the result. If you would like to see the source code for the project please click the source
code button provided at the bottom of each project section. 

Thanks you for taking the time to look at my work if you would like to contact me please do so via:

# [Generic Vector Class in C++](https://github.com/dcanar9/Coursework/tree/master/MyGenericVec)
![Generic Vector Class IMG](/images/GenericVector.png)

The purpose of this project was to show how templating works in C++ and to learn the basic operations
an array can preform. Although vectors already exist, this project taught how the class handles the 
undelying data structure. To view a code run through and sample run, click this [link](https://www.useloom.com/share/b005120a36574512bde76d4549da7698).

**if you want to know how to use the header file its best to watch the video**

# [Card Game Class in C++](https://github.com/dcanar9/Coursework/tree/master/Card%20Game%20Files)

The Card Class is a set of header files to simulate a game of war between to people. The project was to 
demonstrate the use of polymorphism within C++. The class begins at the most basic structure the card, then the 
deck, and finally the hand of the player. The loom video going through code is posted in two parts [here](https://www.useloom.com/share/7d04375206d34c34a146c9d2070cea8e). and [here]( https://www.useloom.com/share/7d04375206d34c34a146c9d2070cea8e)

# [Truth Table Generator in Python](https://github.com/dcanar9/Coursework/tree/master/Truth%20Table)
![Truth Table Example](/images/TruthTable.png)

The Python is all in one file, there are a group of methods that are used to identify the variables, create combinations,
and then finally simplify the actual logical expression. The calculator will take a logical expression (with each symbol seperated
by a space) then give all possibilities using the truth table.

# [Self Solving Maze in C++](https://github.com/dcanar9/Coursework/tree/master/Self%20Solving%20Maze)

<img src="https://github.com/dcanar9/Coursework/blob/master/images/MazeOutput.png?raw=true" width="300" height="450">

The maze works by taking in input from a text file to create the maze. The input is a list of coordinates that state the maze size, starting block, 
finish block, and walls. The maze object is built from the vertices and edges class that then make up the graph class. The maze starts by reading this graph and creating a representation for it with a 2 dimenstional array. The maze is then handed to a maze solver class that uses Dijktras algorithm to find the shortest path to the finish. In the example above, it can be seen the maze starts in the top left corner at the S then teh directional v's show the path to the finish block F.

_This code was made a while ago without proper knowledge of code organization so sorry for the classes all in one cpp file_
